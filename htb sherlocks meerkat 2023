Sherlock Scenario

As a fast growing startup, Forela have been utilising a business management platform. Unfortunately our documentation is scarce and our administrators aren't the most security aware. As our new security provider we'd like you to take a look at some PCAP and log data we have exported to confirm if we have (or have not) been compromised.
